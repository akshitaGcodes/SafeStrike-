Admin: Full access to all features, including ESG Sustainability reports.

Moderator: Access to monitoring, maps, and route optimization.

Worker: Access to core safety features (AQI, Engine health, and Maps).

Guest Credentials for Testing:
Username: 123 | Password: 123 (Role: Worker)

1. Check Air Quality
Enter a sector name (e.g., Sector W1).
The system generates mock sensor data for No2 and S02 

2. Engine Monitoring System
Analyzes vehicle/machinery health based on Temperature, Vibration, and RPM.
If any parameter exceeds safety limits (e.g., Temp > 95°C), the system will issue a Maintenance Warning

3. Sector Information & Mine Map
Sector Info: Provides coordinates and identifies the resource located there (Coal, Iron Ore, or Diamond).
Show Mine Map: Displays an ASCII layout of the mine to help you visualize the connection between sectors.

4. Distance Calculation
Enter two different sectors.
The system calculates the "Manhattan Distance" (grid-based movement) between them to help with logistics planning.

5. Find Green Route (Admin/Moderator Only)
Enter your current location.
The system scans all possible paths to the "Loading Bay" and selects the one with the lowest overall AQI to ensure worker safety.

6. ESG Score Report (Admin Only)
Generates a Sustainability Report based on environmental data (AQI), social safety (Engine health), and governance (User roles).

7.Exit and Security
Select the Logout & Exit option (Option 6, 7, or 8 depending on your role) to safely close your session.
Always ensure you logout if you are using a shared terminal in the mine.
