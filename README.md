Our moto : We don’t just find the minerals we protect the people who find them 

Problem Statement : Eco-mining ->Resonating industrial growth with earth's rhythm. 

Our Aim :-
Our idea aims for sustainability and efficiency, it creates a brain for mine, to create cleaner air for better care, to have a green sight to do it right.
Current mining operations rely on outdated, reactive methods where heavy machinery emits excessive NO₂ and SO₂, air quality is poorly monitored, and engines are run until failure. This leads to unsafe working conditions, inefficient vehicle movement, high emissions, and costly equipment breakdowns. Our solution introduces an intelligent system that analyzes environmental and operational data in real time to identify hazardous zones, optimize routing, pause operations when necessary, and detect engine issues early, enabling safer and more sustainable mining.
