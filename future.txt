FUTURE OF SAFESTRIKE

Replacing mock data with real-time inputs by integrating Air Quality & Weather APIs, to fetch live NO₂, SO₂, wind speed, and humidity data and 
GPS APIs (Google Maps), to calculate actual vehicle routes inside and around mining sites.

This enables dynamic green routing, where vehicle paths automatically adjust based on live pollution levels and weather conditions.

SafeStrike can generate automated environmental reports aligned with government regulations, helping mining companies to be scalable, cost-effective 
and adaptable to both small and large mining operations by following methods:
-Reduce carbon footprint
-Avoid legal penalties
-Improve ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) scores

But what we’ve built today is only the beginning. 
As we look toward the future our roadmap includes a strategic integration with India’s official Mine Maps and the geospatial database,
by layering SafeStrike’s real-time safety data directly onto the government’s Geological Survey maps, 
we can create a 'National Safety Dashboard' for the entire mining sector.
Imagine a future where every active mine in India is digitally synced. 
We won't just be protecting;
we’ll be providing the Ministry of Mines with a live, 3D bird's-eye view of structural stability and hazard zones across the country.
