FUTURE OF SAFESTRIKE

Replacing mock data with real-time inputs by 
integrating Air Quality & Weather APIs, to fetch live NO₂, SO₂, wind speed, and humidity data and 
GPS APIs (Google Maps), to calculate actual vehicle routes inside and around mining sites.
This enables dynamic green routing, where vehicle paths automatically adjust based on live pollution levels and weather conditions.

SafeStrike can generate automated environmental reports aligned with government regulations, helping mining companies to be scalable, cost-effective, and adaptable to both small and large mining operations by following methods:
-Reduce carbon footprint
-Avoid legal penalties
-Improve ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) scores
